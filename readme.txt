The Matlab codes are the library functions and examples that implement the spectral embeddings that we have discussed in the book "Social Networks with Rich Edge Semantics".

The file 'new_Laplacian' provides proposed Matlab library functions.

The file 'figs_color' provides the color version figures corresponding to the book.

Dataset 'Florentine_families' is a typed directed network. Examples in Chapter 4, 5 and 6.
